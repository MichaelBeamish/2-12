puts "Once upon a time there lived a #{noun1} in a #{geographical_feature}. 
One day after a #{adjective1} meal. It was sleeping under a tree.
After a while, there came a #{noun2} and it started to play on the #{noun1}.
Suddenly the #{noun1} got up with anger to see who disturbed its nice sleep.
Then it saw a small #{noun2} standing #{verb2} with fear.
The #{noun1} #{verb1} on it and started to kill it.
The #{noun2} requested the #{noun1} to forgive it.
The #{noun1} felt pity and left it. The #{noun2} ran away at #{number} miles an hour.
On another day, the #{noun1} was caught in a net by a #{noun3}.
The #{noun2} came there and #{verb3} the net. Thus it escaped.
There after, the #{noun2} and the #{noun1} became #{plural_noun1}.
They lived happily in the #{geographical_feature} afterwards."
